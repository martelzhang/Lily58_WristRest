The setup in the photo features a Lily58Pro paired with Kailh Choc V1 low-profile switches.

In the picture above, I used the BOTTOM_CASE.stl instead of the BOTTOM_CASE_OPEN.stl (Lunar58 case).

## Wrist Rest for Lily58Pro & Lunar58
This wrist rest was designed to address wrist strain caused by using low-profile switches with the Lunar58 case.

After multiple rounds of real-world 3D printing tests, you can print my model directly without worrying about the stability or compatibility of the insertion parts.

### Note: This model uses PLA matte material to ensure the aesthetic quality of the case.
